        <p> We provide a wide variety of treatments including: facials, massages, and other body treatments. 
            <ul>
                <h2>Massages</h2>

                <li>CLASSIC SWEDISH • 60 MINUTES $85 / 80 MINUTES $120
                    <p> With long smooth strokes, kneading, and circular movements we
                    are able to relax muscles and push out excess lactic acid in the muscles. This massage is very
                    gentle and relaxing. Recommended for first time massage.</p> 
                </li>
                <li>DEEP TISSUE • 60 MINUTES $100 / 80 MINUTES $130
                    <p>With slower strokes and friction techniques this massage targets the deep layers
                    of the muscles. This massage is for chronically tight or painful muscles, scar tissue from surgeries
                    or injury and repetitive strain. It is not uncommon to be sore for a day or two after this massage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>HOT STONE • 80 MINUTES $135
                    <p>The use of hot smooth basalt stones during this massage allows the belly of the
                    muscle to relax easier and faster than the traditional Swedish (classic) massage. 
                    This also allows the therapist to apply deeper pressure if needed. 
                    Hot stones improve circulation and calms the nervous system.</p>
