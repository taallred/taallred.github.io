            <p>    We provide a wide variety of treatments including: facials, massages, and other body treatments. 
                <ul>
                    <h2>Massages</h2>
                    <li>CLASSIC SWEDISH • 60 MINUTES $85 / 80 MINUTES $120
                        Use of long smooth strokes, kneading, and circular movements we
                        are able to relax muscles and push out excess lactic acid in the muscles. This massage is very
                        gentle and relaxing. Recommended for first time massage. </li>
                    <li>DEEP TISSUE • 60 MINUTES $100 / 80 MINUTES $130
                        With slower strokes and friction techniques this massage targets the deep layers
                        of the muscles. This massage is for chronically tight or painful muscles, scar tissue from surgeries
                        or injury and repetitive strain. It is not uncommon to be sore for a day or two after this massage.</li>
                    <li>HOT STONE • 80 MINUTES $135
                        The use of hot smooth basalt stones during this massage allows the belly of the
                        muscle to relax easier and faster than the traditional Swedish (classic) massage. 
                        This also allows the therapist to apply deeper pressure if needed. 
                        Hot stones improve circulation and calms the nervous system. </li>
                    <h2>Facials</h2>
                    <li>CLASSIC BEAUTY • 60 MINUTES $85

                        Designed for all skin types, this treatment includes cleansing, exfoliation, extractions, custom mask and hydration.</li>
                    <li>GREEN APPLE ENZYME PEEL • 60 MINUTES $120
                        Eliminate the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while firming the skin 
                        using Juice Beauty’s organic Green Apple Enzyme collection.</li>
                    <li>DEEP BREATH • 45 MINUTES $60
                        Using certified organic skincare, this facial detoxifies and replenishes. 
                        Perfect for those not a fan of extractions. </li>

                    <h2>Body Treamtments</h2>
                    <li>ORGANIC BODY POLISH + HYDRATING WRAP • 80 MINUTES $125
                        This experience begins with dry brushing and continues with a luxurious lavender shea butter body polish. 
                        Your body is then drenched with organic oils and wrapped in a cocoon to encourage absorption and hydration.</li>
                    <li>ORGANIC BODY POLISH • 45 MINUTES $85
                        This exfoliating treatment combines dry bushing with an organic exfoliant to sluff away dry, dead, skin cells while smoothing and toning the skin.</li>    
                </ul>
